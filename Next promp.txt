Write a shell script, you need to prompt file path from the user, if the file exists then it should go to next prompt. in next prompt it should ask for word from same file. if the file is not exist I should exit, same for word as well




#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter the file path"
read path
if [ -f $path ]
then
        echo "enter the word to search in the same file"
        read word
        grep -i "$word" $path
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]
        then
                echo "Word exist in file"
        else
                echo "Word doesn't exist in file"
        fi
        else
        echo "File dosen't exist"
fi                
~
